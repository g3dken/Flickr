# Flickr
Android coding test by dgormally

I was tasked with doing a demo app in Android as proof of concept for retrieving Flickr photos.

Searching GitHub reveals numerous repos that aspire to do this exact task (bravo open source!)

Only two repos that I tried in Android Studio 3.0 were ready for prime time:

1. This project by dgormally, which built and ran with no modifications at all.
2. A functionally very similar app by futureproofd which needed some updates to build settings and API references.
